# SOLID--Principles

SOLID PRINCIPLES

-> Single Responsibility
Each call should have only sole(one) purpose,
and not be filled with excessive functionality


->Open Closed
Classes should be opened for extension
closed for modification


->Liskov Substitution
this means that every subclass or derived class should
substitutable for their base or parent class


->Interface Segregation
Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can't do
Large interfaces should be derived into small ones


->Dependency Inversion
Component Should depend on abstractions,
not on concretions
